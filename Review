Comments on overall code:
-	Some files contain comments, but most have a lack thereof
-	Referencing to the source for the code used is good, but do not forget to comment on the code you copied to show that you understand what the code does
-	Delete unused (commented out) or unnecessary code, this distracts from the code that actually matters
-	Explanation of the code at the top of the files is missing on some files
-	Sometimes your comments are underneath the lines of code you’re trying to explain? Comments should be above the corresponding line(s) of code (see MovieAsyncTask.java)
-	Pay attention while writing comments; I’ve noticed some comments which do not match the code (variable names, etc.)
-	Be consistent in the language you choose for the comments
-	Method setData() in MainActivity.java has no code whatsoever; why is it there?
-	There is quite a lot of code in the MovieAdapter.java class that is completely unnecessary for what you are trying to accomplish. If you copy data from a source, try to only use the code you actually need to make it easier for yourself (and others).

Things I take away from this:
- More comments, less unnecessary code!
- Focus on headers and layout of the code. Try to remove redundant lines.
